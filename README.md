## Installing the Server
The server should be downloaded separately from https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter

## Installing the Server 
Copy contents of the package into a folder, and inside this folder run 'npm -install'. This will install all
dependencies for the server system.

## Running the Server
Once the server is installed, go to its directory and run 'node server.js' command. This will start the server
and it will be ready at port 3001 waiting for your application to interact with it. Now it is time to install
and run the application.

## Installing the Application
To install the application, download this repository into a folder, and then run 'npm -install' command in this directory.
All required dependencies will be installed by npm.

## Running the Application
In order to run the application, after the npm installation is completed, make sure you are in the application's directory
and run it with the 'npm start' command. This will start the application. In your browser, you can now navigate to
'http://localhost:3000/' in order to see the application in action.products outside of the source control.
